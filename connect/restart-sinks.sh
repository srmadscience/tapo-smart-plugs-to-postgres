# Restart every tapo JDBC sink connector (and its tasks) on a Kafka Connect
# cluster. Useful after a database/Connect bounce or to clear FAILED tasks
# without re-POSTing config.
#
# By default it restarts only connectors/tasks that are currently FAILED. Pass
# --all to restart everything regardless of state.
#
# Usage:
#   ./connect/restart-sinks.sh                 # restart only FAILED tasks
#   ./connect/restart-sinks.sh --all           # restart all connectors + tasks
#   CONNECT_URL=http://my-connect:8083 ./connect/restart-sinks.sh
