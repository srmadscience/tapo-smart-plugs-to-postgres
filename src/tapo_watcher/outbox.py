"""Store-and-forward outbox for the Kafka producer (copied from velop-watcher).

Every run writes its messages HERE FIRST, then drains the outbox to Kafka if
Kafka is up. The broker (and the Schema Registry it shares a host with) may be
down, and on the Pi every run is a fresh oneshot process, so the files on disk
are the only retry: anything not yet sent stays pending for the next run.
Unlike velop (which only buffered on a Kafka outage) nothing reaches Kafka
without first being on disk.

Why buffer the *logical* message and not the Avro bytes: serializing needs the
Schema Registry on first use, so if Kafka/registry are down we cannot serialize
at all. We therefore store each message as ``(key, value_dict)`` JSON and defer
serialization to drain time, when Kafka is back.

On-disk format:
- One file per topic per buffered run, named ``<topic>.<yyyymmdd_HHMMSS>`` (UTC).
  A ``-N`` suffix is appended only to avoid a same-second collision.
- Content is JSON Lines: one ``{"key": ..., "value": {...}}`` object per line.
  ``datetime`` values (``fetched_at``) survive via a ``{"__dt_ms__": <epoch-ms>}``
  marker, restored to a UTC ``datetime`` on read.
- After a file is successfully replayed it is gzipped in place (``...gz``) so it
  is kept as an archive but never re-sent. ``.gz`` files are ignored on scan.

The drain/buffer helpers take a ``sink`` (a ``KafkaSink``) but this module never
imports ``confluent_kafka`` itself, so it (and its file logic) import cleanly.
